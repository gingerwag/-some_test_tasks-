# Aims:
Conduct research and make a prioritized list of hunting bookmakers for the sales team.  

## Introductory:  

● Companies operating regions: UK, PL, NO.  
● At least 4 metrics must be used to prioritize E-commerce.  
● The result should be in a table format, where the rows will be the names of the campaigns, and the columns will be the criteria for prioritization and additional information  

## Data:  
An upload with data about diggings, where information is indicated on different sheets with different keys: website, funding, visitors, etc.  
● VLOOKUP or SQL can be used to join data into a single list. In both cases, the code/formula must be attached to the answer.  
● The data join for the key “website” will require processing of the data in the column.  
Remove “http://”,”https://”,”www.” from site names, all text after “/” at the end of the main site domain. Example:
Before processing: http://www.tipp24-se.co.uk/websites/tipp24/German/0/herzlich-willkommen
After processing: tipp24-se.co.uk  
● The processing of the “website” field must be done with a regular expression. For this, the site https://regex101.com/ can be used. The regular expression must be attached to the TOR.
